# AI-Powered Sampling Engine for Real-Time Quality Analytics and Cost-Aware Manufacturing

This project proposes an AI-based Smart Sampling system designed to replace outdated AQL methods in Final Visual Inspection (FVI) of semiconductor manufacturing. The system integrates real-time defect detection, adaptive sampling logic, traceability, and economic optimization.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Real-time image-based defect detection using YOLOv8n
- Rule-based and feedback-driven sampling engine
- LightGBM for risk prediction and learning from batch history
- Cost-aware inspection logic: optimize effort vs defect risk
- Modular edge deployment (RPi / Jetson)

## 📊 Tech Stack
- Python, YOLOv8n, LightGBM
- CSV + image datasets
- Jupyter Notebooks for simulation
- Deployed on edge (RPi 4 / Jetson Nano)

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `notebooks/`: Model demos and sampling simulation
- `src/`: Python source code
- `data/`: Defect image dataset and mock sensor logs
- `assets/`: Poster, banner, system diagrams
- `docs/`: Project report and tiered system explanation
